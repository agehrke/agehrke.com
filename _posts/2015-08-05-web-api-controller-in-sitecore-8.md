So you want to create Web API controllers in aÂ Sitecore 8 solution? Use `Sitecore.Services.Infrastructure.Web.Http.ServicesApiController` and add `Sitecore.Services.Core.ServicesControllerAttribute` to namespace your controller. Read [Developer's Guide to Sitecore.Services.Client (PDF)](https://sdn.sitecore.net/upload/sitecore7/75/developer's_guide_to_sitecore.services.client_sc75-usletter.pdf) from page 61 and onward. Controllers will be reachable at:

`/sitecore/api/ssc/{namespace}/{controller}/{id}/{action}`

That's it. No routing setup, no pipeline fiddling. Quick and easy! Just note that Sitecore does not support dependency injection in the controller - at least out of the box.

Below is a full example that shows async/await in a Web API controller - note the `aspnet:UseTaskFriendlySynchronizationContext` appSetting in Web.config.
